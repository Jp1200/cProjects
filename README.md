Compiled with gcc compiler (Ubuntu 11.4.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.4.0

used -lm at end of compile to compile with math library

gcc -o output_name file_name -lm 

Had to use clang++ when compiling rotation.c on MacOS with newst version of Clang as of Sep 16th 2023
Not sure why when just using clang or gcc I was getting "Illegal Hardware instruction"
